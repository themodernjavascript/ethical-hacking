Skills allow you to achieve your desired goals within the available time and resources. As a hacker, you will need to develop and improve skills day by day that will help you get the job done. These skills include learning how to program, use the internet, good at solving problems, and taking advantage of existing security tools.

We will introduce you to the common programming languages and skills that you must know to be a ethical hacker:

## What is a Programming Language?

A programming language is a special language that programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute.

## Why Should You Learn to Program?

* Hackers are the problem solver and tool builders, learning how to program will help you implement solutions to problems. It also differentiates you from script kiddies.
* Writing programs as a hacker will help you to automate many tasks which would usually take lots of time to complete.
* Writing programs can also help you identify and exploit programming errors in applications that you will be targeting.
* You don't have to reinvent the wheel all the time, and there are a number of open source programs that are readily usable. You can customize the already existing applications and add your methods to suit your needs.
