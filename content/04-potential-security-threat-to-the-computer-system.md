A threat of computer system is anything that lead to loss data or physical damage of the hardware and/or infrastructure. 

Knowing how to identify the threat of computer system is the first step in protecting computer systems.

The threats could be accidental, intentional or caused by natural disaster.

We will introduce you about the common computer system threats and how you can protect systems against them.

## What is Security Threat?

Security Threat is defined as a risk which can potentially harm the computer systems and organization. The cause can refer to physical such as someone stealing a computer that contains vital data. The cause can also refer to non-physical such as a virus attack. In this case, we will define a threat as a potential attack from a hacker that can allow them to gain unauthorized access to a computer system.

## What is Physical Threat?

A physical threat is a potential of an incident that may the result in losing or physical damage to the computer systems.

Physical threat is classified into 3 main categories:

* Internal: The threats which including fire, unstable power supply, humidity in the rooms housing the hardware, ..., etc.
* External: These threats include lightning, floods, earthquakes, ..., etc.
* Human: These threats which including theft, vandalism of the infrastructure and/or hardware, disruption, accidental or intentional errors.

## How to Protect Computer Systems from Physical Threat?

To protect computer systems from physical threats, an organization must have physical security control measures:

* Internal: Fire threats could be prevented by the use of automatic fire detectors and extinguishers that do not use water to put out a fire. The unstable power supply can be prevented by the use of voltage controllers. An air conditioner can be used to control the humidity in the computer room.
* External: Lightning protection systems can be used to protect computer systems against such attacks. Lightning protection systems are not 100% perfect, but to a certain extent, they reduce the chances of Lightning causing damage. Housing computer systems in high lands are one of the possible ways of protecting systems against floods.
* Humans: Threats such as theft can be prevented by use of locked doors and restricted access to computer rooms.

## What are Non-physical Threat?

A non-physical threat is a potential cause of an incident that may result in:

* Loss or corruption of system data
* Disrupt business operations that rely on computer systems
* Loss of sensitive information
* Illegal monitoring of activities on computer systems
* Cyber Security Breaches
* Others

The non-physical threats are also known as logical threats:

* Virus
* Trojans
* Worms
* Spyware
* Key loggers
* Adware
* Denial of Service Attacks
* Distributed Denial of Service Attacks
* Unauthorized access to computer systems resources such as data
* Phishing
* Other Computer Security Risks

## How to Protect Computer Systems from Non-physical Threat?

To protect computer systems from the None-physical threats, an organization must have logical security measures in place. The following list shows some of the possible measures that can be taken to protect cyber security threats:

* To protect against viruses, Trojans, worms, ..., etc. an organization can use anti-virus software. In additional to the anti-virus software, an organization can also have control measures on the usage of external storage devices and visiting the website that is most likely to download unauthorized programs onto the userâ€™s computer.
* Unauthorized access to computer system resources can be prevented by the use of authentication methods. The authentication methods can be, in the form of user ids and strong passwords, smart cards or biometric, ..., etc.
* Intrusion-detection/prevention systems can be used to protect against denial of service attacks.There are other measures too that can be put in place to avoid denial of service attacks.
