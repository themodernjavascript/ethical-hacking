A threat of computer system is anything that lead to loss data or physical damage of the hardware and/or infrastructure. 

Knowing how to identify the threat of computer system is the first step in protecting computer systems.

The threats could be accidental, intentional or caused by natural disaster.

We will introduce you about the common computer system threats and how you can protect systems against them.

## What is Security Threat?

Security Threat is defined as a risk which can potentially harm the computer systems and organization. The cause can refer to physical such as someone stealing a computer that contains vital data. The cause can also refer to non-physical such as a virus attack. In this case, we will define a threat as a potential attack from a hacker that can allow them to gain unauthorized access to a computer system.

## What is Physical Threat?

A physical threat is a potential of an incident that may the result in losing or physical damage to the computer systems.

Physical threat is classified into 3 main categories:

* Internal: The threats which including fire, unstable power supply, humidity in the rooms housing the hardware, ..., etc.
* External: These threats include lightning, floods, earthquakes, ..., etc.
* Human: These threats which including theft, vandalism of the infrastructure and/or hardware, disruption, accidental or intentional errors.

## How to Protect Computer Systems from Physical Threat?

To protect computer systems from physical threats, an organization must have physical security control measures:

* Internal: Fire threats could be prevented by the use of automatic fire detectors and extinguishers that do not use water to put out a fire. The unstable power supply can be prevented by the use of voltage controllers. An air conditioner can be used to control the humidity in the computer room.
* External: Lightning protection systems can be used to protect computer systems against such attacks. Lightning protection systems are not 100% perfect, but to a certain extent, they reduce the chances of Lightning causing damage. Housing computer systems in high lands are one of the possible ways of protecting systems against floods.
* Humans: Threats such as theft can be prevented by use of locked doors and restricted access to computer rooms.
